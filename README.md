# [GrizzHacks 8](https://www.grizzhacks.org)

### This year's theme is üçπTROPICALüå¥

We've got lots of work to do! Although we can pretty much stick to this format and just change the designs, I want to encourage doing more.

For new people who aren't sure what they should learn, here's a roadmap:

1. HTML (Brocode has a great 4 hour video that will teach you everything you need)
2. CSS (Brocode has a CSS video too. Learn Flexbox, and maybe even Grid)
3. JavaScript (The Odin Project is a good source. If you know JavaScript, you know enough TypeScript too)
4. React. This is the JavaScript framework this website uses. Read through the docs and make a sample project
5. Git, GitHub. This is for source control! Not hard, but very necessary to work on a team.
6. TailwindCSS. Given you know CSS well, Tailwind should come naturally

Optional:

7. FramerMotion (An animation library for React)
8. Figma/Canva (Graphic Design software, not code)

Remember, developing on groups it's important to¬†**not**¬†commit directly to main. This can accidentally rewrite progress and destroy the working version. Make a branch using git switch -c, and commit your work to that branch. Then make a pull request that the rest of us can review.

If you have any questions,¬†**please**¬†ask me (Kaeden) or Sean. I'm very happy to answer questions--much happier than I am to fix mistakes.
